first of all you need to unzip this files.


After unzipping the file, you'll see two folders: admin and user.

Inside the admin folder, there will be two subfolders: frontend and backend. You need to run the command 
"npm install" 
in both of these folders. 
Similarly, you need to run the same command in the user folder as well.

Once the npm install command has successfully executed, you need to run another command: 
"npm run server". 

This will start your project.
